\subsection*{demo\_example\_gp\_simulation} \label{fun:demo_example_gp_simulation}

\textbf{Description}
\\ Demo to present the simulation of the GP model, describing dynamic
 system. Three different simulations are presented:
\\ (1) ``naive'' simulation (without propagation of uncertainty)
\\ (2) ``exact'' simulation (anayltical propagation of uncertainty)
\\ (3) simulation with numerical (MCMC) propagation of uncertainty.
\\ See:
\\   A. Girard, Approximate Methods for Propagation of Uncertainty
   with Gaussian Process Models, PhD thesis, 2004.

\\ Set flags accordingly.
