\subsection*{demo\_example\_lmgp\_simulation} \label{fun:demo_example_lmgp_simulation}

\textbf{Description}
\\ Demo to present the simulation of the LMGP model of the chosen dynamic
 system. Three different simulations are presented:
\\ (1) ``naive'' simulation (without propagation of uncertainty)
\\ (2) ``exact'' simulation (anayltical propagation of uncertainty)
\\ (3) simulation with numerical (MCMC) propagation of uncertainty.
\\ See:
\\   A. Girard, Approximate Methods for Propagation of Uncertainty
   with Gaussian Process Models, PhD thesis, 2004.
\\ for more info.
\\
\\ Set flags accordingly.
\\
\\ Note:
\\ Currently it can be used only with Gaussian covariance function and
\\ with white noise model (sum of covSEard and covNoise).
