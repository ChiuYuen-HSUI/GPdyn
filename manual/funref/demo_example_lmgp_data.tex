\textbf{Description}
\\ Demo to present how to obtain and compose data for the identification
 of the GP model with incorporated local models (LMGP model).
\\
\\ There are two options how to obtain local model data:
\\ a. analyticaly (set fIdentifyLm to 0)
\\ b. with identification (set fIdentifyLm to 1)
\\
\\ Note:
\\ Currently it can be used only with Gaussian covariance function and
 with white noise model (sum of covSEard and covNoise).
