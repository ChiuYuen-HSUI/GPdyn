\subsection*{mcmc\_getsamplesgaussmix} \label{fun:mcmc_getsamplesgaussmix}


\textbf{Syntax}
\\ \texttt{function [x,y,indexes,samples,xsamples,fwarning] =
\\ \tab mcmc\_getsamplesgaussmix(x,Mi,Sig,N)}

\textbf{Description}
\\ Function returns the samples from the mixtures of Gaussian distributions,
 given by Mi and Sig and also estimates the quality of the
sampled  distribution. First the cumulative distribution is
estimated, then the
 inverse transform method with the use of Matlab random ganerator
is used
 to obtain individual samples.
\\ Inputs:
\\ x .. partitioned input space
\\ Mi .. vector of Gaussian mixture means
\\ Sig .. vectors of Gaussian mixture standard deviations
\\ N ... number of returned samples
\\ Outputs:
\\ x .. partitioned inpout space
\\ y .. probabitily density function (pdf) of Gaussian mixture
\\ indexes .. indexes of chosen samples, should be applied to x to get the
  values
\\ samples .. number of samples at particular elements of x - for testing
   the quality of the \tab approximated distribution
\\ xsamples .. indexes applied to x (samples)
\\ fwarning .. warning flag, risen if less than 98\% of distribution is
   covered with samples
\\
\\ Function uses rand (internal Matlab command) and mcmc\_getgaussmix,
\\ defined at the end of the function. It is used by the function
\\ simul00mcmcm.
